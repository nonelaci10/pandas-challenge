Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

Background
The data dive continues!
Now, it's time to take what you've learned about Python Pandas and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, you'll need to complete one of two (not both)  Data Challenges. Once again, which challenge you take on is your choice. Just be sure to give it your all -- as the skills you hone will become powerful tools in your data analytics tool belt.

Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Pandas Challenge you choose. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: HeroesOfPymoli or  PyCitySchools.


Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.


Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.
